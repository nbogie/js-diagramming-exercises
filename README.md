# Diagramming Exercises

Here are various code snippets for you to try to diagram.

## Instructions

Using a whiteboard or pen and paper, step manually through the execution of the code, statement by statement, building the diagram up.

Use a similar representation to that found in python tutor:
https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=display

-   However, represent any function definitions as just FNDEF, rather than writing out their contained code.

If asked to submit your diagrams (e.g. for a peer to check), the version of the diagram required will be the final state one - that one which shows the program state once it has run its final instruction

## doc build tools

`bash concat-all.sh > all-files.md` will concatenate all the files' javascript contents into the content of one big markdown file.

### exercise ideas

-   add for map
-   add for filter
-   variable shadowing
-   global variables
-   string immutability
-   nested objects
-   edit-in-place
    -   sort
-   impure map
-   passing fn refs
-   building tree structures
-   building linked lists
-   2 objects with one reference as a shared prop val (e.g. 100 psys objects sharing a position)
-   2 arrays are not identical
-   o1 === o2 vs s1 === s2 or n1 === n2
-   losing data by reassignment
-   as ex018 but with a shallow copy
-   as ex018 but requiring a DEEP copy and failing
-   garbage collection and return value

### Activity ideas

#### Peer marking (w marking scheme)

-   each student draws on their own jamboard
-   one page for 1 diagram, numbered
-   peers mark each others diagrams for correctness after:
    -   seeing my solution
    -   seeing my marking scheme (e.g. "b should be undefined, not 'foo'")

### Sequencing

-   kahoot quiz with code prediction to hook students showing them holes in their mental model.
-   quick demo of diagramming
-   students try diagramming in groups
-   peer-to-peer (or group-to-group) marking, with marking scheme
-   self-study with full reference materials
-   revisit kahoot quiz periodically
-   revisit diagramming periodically
